# International Morse-Plaintext<sup>1</sup> Converter
Hey! This is a lua-based converter for going between international morse code, and plaintext<sup>1</sup>. 
It works with numbers, letters, spaces, but no punctuation or special characters, at the moment. Capitalization of text does not matter.

## Running the file
So I actually don't really know how to run lua files locally, I'm too used to game engines handling the runtime for me, so I'll give an alternative I usually use, when I'm programming in Lua without any graphics.

This is [OneCompiler](https://onecompiler.com/lua/). OneCompiler lets you run Lua code (and other languages) on the web. You can just copy and paste the code into here and run it.

The link above will lead you directly to the Lua compiler, for convenience.

## Notes
- 1 •️ Plaintext, as in characters traditionally used in the english language.
- You can test this against the [Morse Code Translator](code.world/international/translator.html), which also lists all the translations in text form.
